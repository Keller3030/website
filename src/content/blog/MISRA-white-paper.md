# **White Paper: Jumpstarting MISRA compliance via the integration of static analysis into Open Source CI systems: best practices and key elements from TrustedFirmware.org**

Over the last two years TrustedFirmware.org has integrated ECLAIR, BUGSENG's MISRA tooling, into TrustedFirwmare's Open CI as part of the validation efforts for both TF-A and TF-M. These verification efforts provide additional confidence in regards to Functional Safety and Security for users of these projects.  The Open CI development team collaborated with the BUGSENG team to create this white paper. It provides a nice high level overview describing what MISRA is checking for and the process used to enable MISRA checking in an Open Source project like TrustedFirmware.org.
